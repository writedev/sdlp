 |
 |  YoutubeDL class.
 |
 |  YoutubeDL objects are the ones responsible of downloading the
 |  actual video file and writing it to disk if the user has requested
 |  it, among some other tasks. In most cases there should be one per
 |  program. As, given a video URL, the downloader doesn't know how to
 |  extract all the needed information, task that InfoExtractors do, it
 |  has to pass the URL to one of them.
 |
 |  For this, YoutubeDL objects have a method that allows
 |  InfoExtractors to be registered in a given order. When it is passed
 |  a URL, the YoutubeDL object handles it to the first InfoExtractor it
 |  finds that reports being able to handle it. The InfoExtractor extracts
 |  all the information about the video or videos the URL refers to, and
 |  YoutubeDL process the extracted information, possibly using a File
 |  Downloader to download the video.
 |
 |  YoutubeDL objects accept a lot of parameters. In order not to saturate
 |  the object constructor with arguments, it receives a dictionary of
 |  options instead. These options are available through the params
 |  attribute for the InfoExtractors to use. The YoutubeDL also
 |  registers itself as the downloader in charge for the InfoExtractors
 |  that are added to it, so this is a "mutual registration".

 |                     and a list of additional command-line arguments for the
 |                     postprocessor/executable. The dict can also have "PP+EXE" keys
 |                     which are used when the given exe is used by the given PP.
 |                     Use 'default' as the name for arguments to passed to all PP

 |                      - path: Path to the executable (optional)
